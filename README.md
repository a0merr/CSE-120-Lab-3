## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the code for **Lab 3** in CSE 120. The lab focuses on **working with lists, user input, and performing operations on lists**.  

The program prompts the user to:  
1. Enter a list of **13 numbers** separated by commas  
2. Enter a **multiplication number**  

The program then multiplies each number in the list by the multiplication number and displays the results.  

The goal of this lab was to practice:  
- Collecting and **processing user input**  
- Using **list comprehension** for calculations  
- Working with **lists in Python**  
- Printing and formatting output
